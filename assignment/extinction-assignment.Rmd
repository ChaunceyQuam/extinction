## Mass Extinctions Module

_Are we experiencing the sixth great extinction?_  

What is the current pace of extinction? Is it accelerating? How does it compare to background extinction rates?

## Background

- [Section Intro Video](https://youtu.be/QsH6ytm89GI)
- [Ceballos et al (2015)](http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1400253)

Our focal task will be to reproduce the result from Ceballos and colleagues showing the recent increase in extinction rates relative to the background rate:

### Data about the species:

Here we use RESTful API to read in data about all species evaluated by the IUCN Red List.
```{r}
species_ap <- "https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/species"
page <- "/page/"
page_number <- 0:10
query <- "?token="
token <- "9bb4facb6d23f48efbf424bb05c0c1ef1cf6f468393bc745d42179ac4aca5fee"

#write a function to get http, clue everything together to make a url that iterates over the vector of page_number
all_pages <- paste0(species_ap, page, page_number, query, token)
```

We will get the results for all 10 pages, each has 10,000 records of all species published. 
```{r all_results, cache = TRUE}
#apply map to all_pages a vector
all_results <- map(all_pages, GET)
```

Let's look at the names of the data.
```{r}
row <- all_results[[1]] %>% content() %>% getElement("result") %>% getElement(1)
names(row)
```

Here we turn the data into "rectangle" as a dataframe. According to the paper by Ceballos on species extinctions, Both extinct species and extinct in the wild species were selected to make their final graph. To reproduce their result, we are filtering to have only species under the two categories.
```{r}
row_to_tibble <- function(row){
  tibble(scientific_name = row$scientific_name, 
         category = row$category, 
         class = row$class_name,
         kingdom = row$kingdom_name)
}

get_result <- function(x){
  x %>% content() %>% getElement("result") %>% 
  map_dfr(row_to_tibble)
}

```
```{r cache=TRUE}
all_species <- all_results  %>% map_dfr(get_result) %>% filter(category=="EX"| category=="EW")
all_species
```

We can see that 989 species went extinct. Let's see the unique classes of species.
```{r}
unique(all_species$class)
```

### Data about the species extinction dates:

Lets get the extinction dates for these species. The data is store in the narrative text for each species. Again, we are setting up the url to be called in the RESTful API.
```{r}
#setting the species table individually
all_extinct <- all_species %>% pull(scientific_name)

#variables of a url
base <- "https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org"
narrative <- "/api/v3/species/narrative/"
name_group1 <- all_extinct
query <- "?token="
token <- "9bb4facb6d23f48efbf424bb05c0c1ef1cf6f468393bc745d42179ac4aca5fee"
url <- paste0(base, narrative, name_group1, query, token)
```

We have already called the urls for all the extinct species (this will take awhile) and saved it as an R object RDS. The code chunk below will load the object if the file exists or it will download the data if the file doesn't exist. Then this object consists of all extinct and extinct in the wild species is read into all_data.
```{r}
if (!file.exists("massive_resp.rds")){
  resp <- map(url, GET)
  saveRDS(resp, "massive_resp.rds")
} else {
  all_data <- readRDS("massive_resp.rds")
}
```

We will need to get the rationale section for each species in order to find out what date they went extinct. 
Here are the narratives of the species, the narratives that are NULL are stored as NA.
```{r cache=TRUE}
map_chr_na <- possibly(map_chr, as.character(NA))

narrative <- all_data %>% map(content) %>% map("result") %>% 
  map(map_chr_na, "rationale")
```

This is an example of how one species can have more than 1 string paragraph of narrative. This will need to deal with in the next step.
```{r}
(map_int(narrative, length) >1) %>% which()
narrative[666]
```

Lets extract the extinction date for species that have dates in their narrative. We created a custom function to extract any 4 digit number from the rationales. We then unlist them as they are nested in lists as we have seen above.
```{r}
extinc_year <- map(narrative, function(x){
  str_extract_all(x, "\\d{4}") %>% 
  unlist()
}) 
```

Here is the function that will bin the years for all species into the specific bins for our final graph. Since we are using bins of interval 100 years. It is reasonable to put them in these bins. 
For rationales of species that contain more than one year, if the years are within the 100-year interval, we will collapse them into the same bin. If they are not within the 100-year interval however, we will select the latest year and put it in the corresponding bin. We chose to do so because we observed that the narratives have a tendency to list the last seen date as the date of approximate extinction.
Lastly, if there is no narrative, or Null values, we will give them NA as values. 
```{r}
bin_year <- function(x) {
  x = as.integer(x)
    case_when(
      between(x, 1500, 1600) ~ "1600",
      between(x, 1600, 1700) ~ "1700",
      between(x, 1700, 1800) ~ "1800",
      between(x, 1800, 1900) ~ "1900",
      between(x, 1900, 2020) ~ "2000",
      !between(x, 1500, 2020) ~ as.character("not a year"),
      length(x) < 1 ~ as.character(NA)) %>%
      unique() %>%
      max()
}
```

Here we apply our binning function to all the years that we extracted from the species rationale to come up an extinction date for each species. It is important to note that we assigned all null narratives which were replaced to NAs by our binning function earlier to have 1900 as its values. Our rationale is that although we do not have the exact date to bin these species, they are nonetheless listed as extinct as of now, which is in the 20th century.
```{r warning=FALSE}
all_year <- 
  extinc_year %>% 
  map(possibly(bin_year, NA_real_)) %>%
  as.integer() %>% 
  replace_na(2000)
```

Here are are adding the dates of 989 extinct dates that we derived from the narratives earlier to the table of 989 species from our initial species table which consists of EX - Extinct and EW - Extinct in the Wild species.
```{r}
all_species_with_year <- all_species %>%
  mutate("extinct_year" = all_year)
all_species_with_year
```

### Reproduce the graph that Cellabos made for cummulative extinctions as percentages of all IUNC-evaluated species

Here we have the sorted the species table with extinction dates into 4 different groups Mammals, Birds, Vertebrates and Other vertebrates. 
```{r}
verte <- c("MAMMALIA","AVES","REPTILIA","AMPHIBIA")
birds <- all_species_with_year %>% filter(class == "AVES")
mammals <- all_species_with_year %>% filter(class == "MAMMALIA")
vertebrate <- all_species_with_year %>% filter(class %in% verte)
all_other <- all_species_with_year %>% filter(!class %in% verte)
                                              

vert <- vertebrate %>%
  group_by(extinct_year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(name = "Vertebrate")

birdies <- birds %>%
  group_by(extinct_year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(name = "Birds")

mammalies <- mammals %>%
  group_by(extinct_year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(name = "Mammals")

others <- all_other %>%
  group_by(extinct_year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(name = "Other Vertebrates")

master_ex_table <- rbind(birdies, mammalies, vert, others)
master_ex_table
```

Tn order to arrive at the fractions of accumulative extinctions as percentages of IUCN-evaluated species, we need to divide the total of a species of each group in each bin to the total number of that species.
To get each special total count, we made a new table to have only total counts for 4 groups (birds, mammals, vertebrate, other vertebrates). 
We joined this table to our current master extict table to create another more comprehensive table. With the total counts and species count per bin year, we can arrive at the fraction desired. 
```{r}
all_extinct_total <- data.frame(name = c("Birds", "Mammals", "Vertebrate", "Other Vertebrates"), 
                                  sum_species = c(nrow(birds), nrow(mammals), nrow(vertebrate),nrow(all_other)))
all_extinct_total                                

master_ex_table <- rbind(birdies, mammalies, vert, others) %>%
  left_join(all_extinct_total) %>%
  mutate(fraction_extinct = count/ sum_species)
master_ex_table
```

Comparing to the Fig. 1 graph in Ceballos's paper, we see that the graph was made using data as of 2012. It has been almost 8 years since then. Our graph is reflecting the changes in the extinction rates. 

![](https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/img/extinctions.jpg)
```{r}
master_ex_table %>% ggplot(aes(x = extinct_year, group = name, color = name)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = fraction_extinct)) +
  labs(title = "Cumulative Vertebrate Species as EX or EW by the IUCN 2019",
       y = 'Cumulative extinctions as % of UCN-evaluated species',
       x = "Time interval") +
  
    
```


The background rate used by Gerardo Ceballos is 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (2E/MSY). The modern extinction rate is 100 times higher than this background rate. 

We can compare the rates of extinction between using "EX" = "extinction" category and "EW" = "extinction in the wild" and "PE" = "possibly extinct"
